<<h1 style="background-color:Violet;">I am a computer science student and a Technical Recruiter</h1>
  
  
<p> My name in Rebecca. I'm currently studying Computer Science. As my profession, I am a Technical recruiter.
  I would like to find skilled Software Engineers who are looking for a new challange in their careers.
  IF you are interested in making a change, please feel free to reach out to me. My email is rpearre@starshr.com
  I also choose this platform for gaining and practicing my coding skills. I would love to learn from the expert 
  coders on here. My skill level is beginner in HTML5 so that is what I'm working on now with the help of this
  site and of course, freecodecamp.org</p>
